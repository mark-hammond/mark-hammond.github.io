      <description>I am a Junior Research Fellow at Christ Church College at the University of Oxford. I work in Atmospheric, Ocean, and Planetary Physics in the Department of Physics.
I study the atmospheres of exoplanets, using mathematical and computational models to understand their atmospheric circulation. I am particularly interested in the global atmospheric dynamics of tidally locked planets, which always present the same side to their host star.
I have published on topics such as the observable features of lava planets, the mechanisms for the formation of atmospheric jets on tidally locked planets, and a method for decomposing their atmospheric circulation into physically distinct components.</description>

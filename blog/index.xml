      <description>A new paper with Dorian Abbot, finished up after most of the work was done in my stint at Chicago in 2020. Something of a technical study into 3D modelling of hot Jupiter atmospheres, and hopefully laying the groundwork for a full study of their angular momentum budgets and equatorial jets in the future. Link at https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/511/2/2313/6517472.
Abstract
Hot Jupiters are tidally locked gaseous exoplanets with atmospheric circulations dominated by a super-rotating equatorial jet.</description>

      <description>A new paper with Neil Lewis on a new way to divide up the atmospheric circulation of tidally locked planets! We enjoyed writing this, you can read it at https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2022705118.
Abstract
Tidally locked exoplanets likely host global atmospheric circulations with a superrotating equatorial jet, planetary-scale stationary waves, and thermally driven overturning circulation. In this work, we show that each of these features can be separated from the total circulation by using a Helmholtz decomposition, which splits the circulation into rotational (divergence-free) and divergent (vorticity-free) components.</description>

      <title>The Equatorial Jet Speed on Tidally Locked Planets. I. Terrestrial Planets</title>

      <description>A study that I greatly enjoyed, on the formation of equatorial jets on rocky tidally locked planets. We used the highly impressive Dedalus code and came up with a mechanism for the formation of jets in idealised atmospheres. A follow-up on gaseous planets to come! Link at https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abb08b/meta.
Abstract
The atmospheric circulation of tidally locked planets is dominated by a superrotating eastward equatorial jet. We develop a predictive theory for the formation of this jet, proposing a mechanism in which the three-dimensional stationary waves induced by the dayâ€“night forcing gradient produce an equatorial acceleration.</description>
